<br>
"Save the Egg" is a Python command line interface (CLI) game. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by dropping the egg from as high as possible without breaking it. To protect the egg from breaking, the user can use different materials. The game features three levels, each increasing in difficulty to make it less predictable.

# User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI)

## User Goals
"Save the Egg" is created for the user as a fun game to test the forcelimit of a egg. The game is shown in a Command Line Interface and the leaderboard is stored in a secure Google Sheet. This are some ponits that i have focust on when making this project

  - It must be easy to navigate and to understand the rules the first time the user read them
  - An engaging UI to capture the user's interest.
  - Clear instructions for entering data correctly are provided.
  - No dead ends to trap the user at the end of a function.
